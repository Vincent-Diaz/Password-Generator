# Password-Generator
The Password Generator project is a web app that generates secure random passwords for users. The user is presented with a series of prompts for the password criteria including, special characters, numeric characters, upper and lower case characters. Depending on the users input, the program then randomizes and generates a password based on the users preferred criteria.
I completed this program with a series of if/else conditions, multiple arrays/variables, for loops, and certain perameters to make sure the users input is valid and defined. 
While writing out the code for the if/else conditions.. I proceeded to use the "concat" method to combine the arrays into one main array based on th users selected inputs.
As the overall project was difficult in some ways, I would go on to do some research in Google to find answers or solutions for the areas I had found difficult.
